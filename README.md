Healthcare Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

 Project Overview
Healthcare fraud is a major issue that leads to financial loss and misuse of medical resources.  
This project uses **Machine Learning with Python** to analyze healthcare claim data and predict whether a claim is **fraudulent or genuine** based on historical patterns.

The objective is to build a reliable classification model that can assist insurance companies and hospitals in identifying suspicious claims early.
