# Fraud Detection in Healthcare using Machine Learning

Overview
This repository contains a "research-based project" on detecting healthcare fraud using "Machine Learning" techniques such as "Local Outlier Factor (LOF)" and "Random Forest".  
The project reviews key studies, datasets, and proposes a hybrid ML-based approach to improve fraud detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

Project Details
- Project Type: Research Paper

- Keywords: Machine Learning, Fraud Detection, LOF, Random Forest, Healthcare

Abstract
Healthcare fraud detection is a major challenge due to the complexity and scale of insurance data.  
This study reviews various ML and data mining approaches for detecting anomalies and proposes a hybrid model using Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for anomaly detection and Random Forest for classification.  
The approach improves precision, lowers false positives, and supports real-time fraud identification in healthcare systems.
